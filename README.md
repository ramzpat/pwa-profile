# pwa-profile

Ongoing work for building a profile web page that can work without an internet connection.

## Intention
I also want to learn about how to make an offline web app. This is inspired by Pokedex.org. 
In this work, I want to simply use `React` and `Typescript` to make an offline experience quicker. 
Since I don't have any experience in building a website, this work could take more time...
